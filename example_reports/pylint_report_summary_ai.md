### Summary of Linting Issues

#### Most Frequent Issues:
1. **Line Length Exceeded (C0301):** Numerous instances of lines exceeding the recommended length of 100 characters.
2. **Trailing Whitespace (C0303):** Several lines contain unnecessary trailing whitespace.
3. **Wrong Import Order (C0411):** Standard and third-party imports are not ordered correctly.
4. **Unspecified Encoding (W1514):** Files are opened without specifying an encoding.
5. **Logging Format (W1203):** Improper use of f-strings in logging functions instead of lazy `%` formatting.
6. **Import Errors (E0401):** Modules are unable to import certain packages.
7. **Missing Final Newline (C0304):** Some files are missing a newline at the end.
8. **Duplicate Code (R0801):** Similar code blocks are repeated across multiple files.

#### Severe Issues:
1. **Import Errors (E0401):** Critical as they can prevent the code from running.
2. **Broad Exception Caught (W0718):** Catching general exceptions can mask other issues.
3. **Unused Variables and Arguments (W0612, W0613):** Indicate potential logical errors or inefficiencies.

### Impact on Code Quality

- **Readability:** Long lines and trailing whitespace reduce readability and maintainability.
- **Maintainability:** Wrong import order and duplicate code make the codebase harder to manage and extend.
- **Robustness:** Import errors and unspecified encoding can lead to runtime errors and data corruption.
- **Performance:** Unused variables and improper logging can lead to inefficient code execution.

### Suggested Fixes and Refactoring Strategies

1. **Line Length and Whitespace:**
   - Break long lines into multiple lines using line continuation or helper functions.
   - Remove trailing whitespace using an editor or automated tool.

2. **Import Order:**
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines: standard library imports first, followed by third-party imports, and then local imports.

3. **Encoding:**
   - Always specify an encoding when opening files, e.g., `open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8')`.

4. **Logging:**
   - Use lazy `%` formatting in logging, e.g., `logger.debug("Value: %s", value)`.

5. **Import Errors:**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed and correctly referenced in the code.

6. **Duplicate Code:**
   - Refactor common code blocks into utility functions or classes to promote reuse.

7. **Exception Handling:**
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than using a general `Exception`.

8. **Unused Variables:**
   - Remove or utilize unused variables and arguments to clean up the code.

### Overall Quality Assessment

The codebase has a moderate level of quality with a pylint score of 5.65/10. The presence of numerous style violations, import errors, and duplicate code indicates a need for significant refactoring. Addressing these issues will improve readability, maintainability, and robustness, leading to a more efficient and reliable codebase. Prioritizing the resolution of import errors and encoding issues is crucial for ensuring the code runs correctly.
