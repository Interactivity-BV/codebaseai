Here is (part of) a method from a Java class. This methods might contain neo4j API version 3.5 code. 
Refactor the method to use neo4j API version 5.+ code. Output the refactored method only.
When there is nothing to refactor, output the original method. 
Please refrain from any comments: the output needs to only Java code! 
Key instructions:
    - Refactor the method to use neo4j API version 5.+ code: `success` is replaced with `commit`, and methods such as `getNodes` are move to the `Transaction` class, amongs other changes.  
    - Output the refactored method only.
    - When there is nothing to refactor, output the original method.
    - it is Java coed, not JavaScript. Make sure all variables are typed for example
