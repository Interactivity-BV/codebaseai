# Onboarding Guide for New Developers

Welcome to the team! This guide will help you get started with our codebase, which is designed to analyze Python repositories using standard tools and AI. Below, you'll find an overview of the codebase structure, key modules to focus on, and the typical development workflow.

## Codebase Structure

Our codebase is organized into several modules, each with specific responsibilities. Here's a brief overview of each module:

1. **create_reports.py**: This module is responsible for generating summary reports from various analysis tools using AI. It includes functions to create reports for Vulture, Pylint, Radon CC, and Radon MI, as well as a function to create a full summary report.

2. **create_docstrings.py**: This module uses OpenAI's language model to generate docstrings for Python scripts. It includes functions to create docstrings, generate documentation summaries, and create onboarding guides.

3. **ai.py**: This module handles the connection to the OpenAI API and executes chains of runnables to process input data and generate AI responses.

4. **refactor_java.py**: This module focuses on refactoring Java code using AI. It includes functions to refactor methods, remove and restore comments, and extract and refactor methods from Java files.

5. **create_readme.py**: This module generates or updates a README.md file based on input extracted from the codebase.

6. **commands.py**: This module executes shell commands and logs their output. It handles command execution errors and logs warnings or errors based on the command's exit status.

7. **analyse_codebase.py**: This module runs various analysis tools (Vulture, Pylint, Radon) on the codebase to check for unused code, code quality, and code complexity.

## Key Modules to Focus On

As a new developer, you should focus on understanding the following key modules:

- **create_reports.py**: Learn how this module generates AI-based summary reports for different analysis tools. Understanding this module will help you contribute to improving our reporting capabilities.

- **create_docstrings.py**: Familiarize yourself with how this module uses AI to generate docstrings. This will be useful if you need to enhance our documentation generation process.

- **ai.py**: Understanding how we connect to and interact with the OpenAI API is crucial for any AI-related enhancements or troubleshooting.

## Typical Development Workflow

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Clone the repository from GitHub and set up your development environment. Ensure you have access to the necessary API keys and tools.

2. **Run Code Analysis**: Use the `analyse_codebase.py` module to run Vulture, Pylint, and Radon analyses on the codebase. This will help you understand the current state of the code and identify areas for improvement.

3. **Generate Reports**: Use the `create_reports.py` module to generate summary reports from the analysis results. Review these reports to gain insights into code quality and complexity.

4. **Enhance Documentation**: Use the `create_docstrings.py` module to generate or update docstrings in the codebase. Ensure that all functions and modules are well-documented.

5. **Refactor Code**: If working with Java code, use the `refactor_java.py` module to refactor methods and improve code quality.

6. **Update README**: Use the `create_readme.py` module to generate or update the README.md file with the latest information about the codebase.

7. **Commit and Push Changes**: Once you've made your changes, commit them to your local repository and push them to the remote repository on GitHub.

8. **Review and Collaborate**: Engage with other team members for code reviews and collaborate on improving the codebase.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a high-level overview of our codebase and development workflow. As you become more familiar with the code, you'll be able to contribute more effectively to our projects. Don't hesitate to reach out to your team members if you have any questions or need assistance. Welcome aboard, and happy coding!
