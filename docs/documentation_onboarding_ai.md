# Onboarding Guide for New Developers

Welcome to the team! This guide will help you get acquainted with our codebase and development workflow. Our project leverages AI to analyze Python repositories using standard tools. Below, you'll find an overview of the codebase structure, key modules to focus on, and the typical development workflow.

## Codebase Structure

Our codebase is organized into several key modules, each serving a specific purpose in the analysis and documentation process. Here's a breakdown of the main modules:

### 1. `create_reports.py`
This module is responsible for generating summary reports from various analysis tools using AI. It includes functions to create reports for:
- **Vulture**: Identifies unused code.
- **Pylint**: Checks code quality.
- **Radon CC**: Analyzes cyclomatic complexity.
- **Radon MI**: Assesses maintainability index.

The module also includes a function to create a comprehensive report combining all analyses and a main function to orchestrate the report generation process.

### 2. `create_docstrings.py`
This module automates the creation of docstrings for Python scripts using OpenAI's language model. It includes functions to:
- Generate docstrings for scripts.
- Summarize documentation.
- Create onboarding guides for new developers.

The main function in this module processes Python scripts in the codebase to add docstrings.

### 3. `ai.py`
This module handles the execution of AI tasks. It includes a function to run a chain of AI processes using a prompt template and input data. It also manages error handling and logging for AI operations.

### 4. `commands.py`
This module is responsible for executing shell commands and logging their output. It includes error handling for command execution failures and logs information, warnings, or errors based on the results.

### 5. `analyse_codebase.py`
This module runs various analysis tools on the codebase. It includes functions to:
- Analyze unused code with Vulture.
- Check code quality with Pylint.
- Assess code complexity and maintainability with Radon.

The main function in this module coordinates the execution of all analysis tools.

## Key Modules to Focus On

As a new developer, you should focus on understanding the following modules:

- **`create_reports.py`**: Learn how reports are generated and how AI is used to summarize analysis results.
- **`create_docstrings.py`**: Understand how docstrings are created and how the module contributes to code documentation.
- **`analyse_codebase.py`**: Familiarize yourself with the analysis tools and how they are integrated into the workflow.

## Typical Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have access to the codebase and necessary tools. Clone the repository from GitHub and set up your development environment.

2. **Code Analysis**: Use the `analyse_codebase.py` module to run Vulture, Pylint, and Radon analyses on the codebase. This will help you identify areas for improvement.

3. **Report Generation**: Utilize the `create_reports.py` module to generate AI-enhanced summary reports of the analysis results. Review these reports to understand the current state of the codebase.

4. **Documentation**: Use the `create_docstrings.py` module to add or update docstrings in the codebase. This ensures that the code is well-documented and easier to maintain.

5. **Development**: Implement new features or fix issues based on the analysis and documentation. Follow best practices for coding and documentation.

6. **Testing and Review**: Test your changes thoroughly and seek peer reviews to ensure quality and adherence to project standards.

7. **Deployment**: Once your changes are approved, deploy them according to the project's deployment process.

8. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly run analyses and update documentation to maintain code quality and project health.
